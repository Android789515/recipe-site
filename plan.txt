}

- Current recipe page {

}

Components
==========

- Header {
    Contains favicon?, search button w/Icon, and profile button w/Icon.
}

- Sidebar {

}

- Current recipe info {
    Might use grid for this.

    Contains picture on the left, info on the right.
    On mobile, picture takes full width of container;
    on large screens, there will be padding in the container.

    Title at top, share button w/Icon at top right,
    and icons at the bottom: stars, ?, time, and calories.
}

- Primary button {
    Has hover and active.

    Login button and new recipe button look very different in terms of button content.
    The only similarities I can see are the background and pill shape.

    Wraps inside another component as a render prop, so the outer component can provide
    functionality such as logging in or adding a new recipe.
}

- Button w/Icon {
    Uses a toggle hook and will modify a simple boolean state value,
    which will determine if a component such as the search box or profile tab will
    appear.


}

- Ingredient input form {
    Deletable

    2 inputs, 1 for the ingredient and 1 for calories
}

- Description form {
    Resizable text area;
}

Note: I don't see any submit buttons for the 2 above forms
so I will assume for now that they submit on enter

- Log in form {
    Has hide/show functionality for password; password is serialized when hidden.

    Submits an ajax request to the server to log in.
}
